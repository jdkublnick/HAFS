Sample Forecast #1: Hurricane Ian
===================================

**Objective:**

Weather Summary
-----------------

Hurricane Ian was a powerful and destructive Category 4 hurricane that caused significant damage across the southeastern United States and the Caribbean in September 2022. Ian developed from a tropical wave that moved off the west coast of Africa and steadily intensified as it approached the Caribbean Sea. The hurricane made landfall in western Cuba before entering the Gulf of Mexico, where it rapidly strengthened and headed towards the Florida coastline. The combination of warm sea surface temperatures and favorable atmospheric conditions contributed to Ianâ€™s rapid intensification. The hurricane brought catastrophic storm surge, heavy rainfall, and powerful winds to the affected regions, resulting in widespread flooding and structural damage.

**Weather Phenomena:** Extreme winds, storm surge leading to extreme flooding, heavy rain, and numerous tornadoes.
